        You can order a sim card ahead of time (to my place) and 
        use it for free for one month of data, it usually takes a 
        few days to arrive so it's totally worth it!

            choose the free prepaid sim card option, use my number at the begining 
            076 652 44 56 (or any other number), it comes with 10 francs for 
            free and you can buy a data plan for a month, 
            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">don't use the internet before you book this plan.</b>

            If you order these from my place and you don't have time to wait I 
            can give you one from another Couchsurfer straight away so you don't 
            have to wait for the sim cards to arrive per post.

            Yallo officially stopped offering 10 franks for free but if you write their 
            support they still give 5-10 franks, so it's worth a shot!
