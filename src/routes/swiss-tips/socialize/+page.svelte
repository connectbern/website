    <ul>
        <li>
            Check out the <a href="/groups" target="_blank">groups</a>
            to meet people or get help with any advice
        </li>
        <li>
            just join them and ask people whatever you want 
            (instead of asking me and my flat mates for example ðŸ˜‰)
        </li>
        <li>
            please check what the group is about before spamming it with 
            a question that is not relevant to the topic of the group ðŸ™ˆ 
            but you can always use the main group 
            <a href="/groups/connect-bern" target="_blank">
                (Connect Bern)
            </a> 
            to ask about anything!
        </li>
    </ul>
